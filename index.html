    <div class="info"><p>Hello! This is Mai.</p><p>It's a some kind of chat bot that processes the given sentences by spliting it with whitespaces into words and processing the relations between the words by looking their usage frequency with each other.</p> <p>It has zero knowledge in its mind right now.</p> <p>Try to say basic sentences with words without dots or commas to make it learn some relations between words and then try to talk with it.</p> <p>Example: i like cats</p></div>
