# Mai
Mai is like a chat bot.

The idea behind it to make it create concepts out of words that is given it as input. It tries to store the created concepts and try to create new sentences by looking the relation between the concepts.

It is really dumb but at least it can create good answers if you feed it well.

Try to feed it with sentences (no comma, dots, signs and seperate words with whitespaces) and than try to talk about these concepts.
